COMPUTER APPRECIATION
</b></center><br>
<p style="margin-left:80px; margin-right: 50px; text-align:justify">
Today we are in a very exciting era of human civilization “the computer age”. The computer world is already with us and is beginning to change our existing way of life. The effect of this change is such that in the near future anyone who does not know how to operate a computer would not fit into the society and would be considered “functionally illiterate”.<br><br>
So, against this background of this existing future, where does the individual stand or how does he or she relate to it? This book is written to help students and none students who really want to learn how to operate and use computer. Since the computer is going to play a major role in the future of modern day lives, it is very important that everybody should know how to use and operate the computer because the world is revolving into digital state.<br><br>
<b>WHAT IS A COMPUTER</b><br>
To many people thinking and what they say <strong>“a Computer is a Magic Machine”</strong>. Candid speaking, computer is not an intelligent machine as most people think it to be. It cannot think, it has no intelligence and does only what it is commanded to do, but it does it at a very fast speed. It is this speed factor that makes the computer a <strong>“Magic Machine”</strong>. So one may ask, what is a computer?<br><br>
<b><i>“A computer is electronic devices that accept information in inform of letters and numbers and processes them according to some lay-down instructions and procedures and then produces the result”</i></b>.<br>
This definition can simply be likened to the human body where the Mouth is the Input Device; the Stomach is the Processor and the Anus is the output device.<br><br>
<b>TYPES OF COMPUTER</b><br>
There are three main classes of computer and these are <b>Analog</b>, <b>Digital</b> and <b>Hybrid computers</b>.<br> 
i. <b>Analog computer:-</b> is designed to process continuous flows of signal.<br>
ii. <b>Digital computer:-</b> is designed to process data that can be converted to digits.<br>
iii. <b>Hybrid Computer:-</b> this type of computer has the characteristics of both analog and digital computers. That is why is referred to as Hybrid computer. <br><br>Today most computers that are been used are Digitals because Analog computers are no longer existence (that is they have be face-off) and Hybrid Computer is for high specialize Industries and Firms like MTN, AIRTEL, GLO, and 9MOBILE e.t.c.<br><br>Base on Digital computer, computers are classified into two major groups;-<br>
1. <b>Programmable Computer:-</b> Programming computers are designed to perform only one (1) specify set of task e.g. Calculator.<br>
2. <b>Non- programmable computer:-</b> A Non-programmable computer is designed to perform different set of Task at different Time. That is Why we called it Non-programmable computer, it can perform so many tasks at a time.<br><br>
It is the different programs that exist in the computer that makes this possible. A computer can be programmed for typing letter, drawing and printing at a time, while at the same time it could be programmed to be showing film. A Non-Programmable computer what it can do depends on the types of program you have in the computer?<br>

Today most general discussions on computer actually refer to Non-Programmable computer. Again under the Non-Programmable computer, computer can be classified into four main groups base on their physical size, storage and their processing capabilities. <br>The four major groups are:-<br> 
1.	Super Computers,<br><br> 
2.	Mainframe Computers, <br><br>
3.	Tower Computers and <br><br>
4.	Macro Computer or Personal Computer (PC for short).<br><br> 

In this book all topics treated are related to personal computer (PC) and they comes in different sizes. E.g. Laptop, Desktop, Notebook, Palm top and Mini-Tower etc. The abbreviation PC may be used from time to time in place of personal computer.<br><br>
<b>PARTS OF A PERSONAL COMPUTER</b><br>           	
The personal computer is made up of three main parts and these are:<br><br>
1.	THE SYSTEM UNIT<br><br>
2.	THE MONITOR<br><br>
3.	THE KEYBOARD<br><br>
Any other device used or connected with the computer is referred to as accessories or peripherals.<br><br>

1.	<b>The System Unit</b>
Picture above is the System Unit, but most People mistakenly call it CPU (central processing unit), which is wrong. The central processing unit <strong>(CPU)</strong> is a component found inside the system units. Below are some of the components found inside the system unit are:<br><br>
a.	<b>THE PROCESSOR</b>: - This is the brain of the computer and it processes and interprets all information sent to the computer. The processor is what we call central processing unit (CPU). A personal computer can have any of these processors; 80206, 80386, 80486, Pentium1, Pentium2, 3, 4, M and Dual - Core. The speed of a processor is measured in <strong>Mega-Hertz {MHz}</strong>. The higher the speed of a processor, the faster the processor, and hence the faster the computer.<br><br>

b.	<b>MEMORY (RAM)</b>: - There are two types of memory found inside the personal computer and these are RAM and the ROM. Ram stands for Random Access Memory while Rom stand for Read Only Memory. All programs that are running in the computer and all data processed in a computer are store in the Ram. So the Ram needs power to hold data so in the event of power failure all information in the Ram will not lost unless they where not saved (stored) into a disk.
Rom on the other hand stands for Read Only Memory. The contents of Rom is permanent and is not erased in the event of power failure. The Rom holds special programs known as <strong>firmware</strong>. Since a program must be loaded into the ram memory of a computer to run, the amount of ram a computer has is very essential to the computer. The bigger the ram, the more programs you can run at a time and the more data you can work on at a time. Ram sizes are expressed in <b>mega-bytes</b>.

c.	<b>Ports</b>: Ports are used to connect certain devices such as printers, mouse, monitors etc, to the system unit. There are three types of port and these are <strong>Parallel ports</strong>, <strong>Serial ports</strong> and <strong>Unversal Serial Bus (USB)</strong>. Parallel ports have Pins and they are known as Male ports while Serial ports have holes and they are known as female ports.<br><br>

d. <b>Drives</b>: The common drives found in most computers are the Hard Disk Drive, Floppy Disk Drive and CD-Rom drive. The hard disk drive holds a fixed disk known as the <b>Hard Disk or fixed disk</b>. It is fixed inside the system unit and it can hold a large amount of data. It contains all the programs and software used by the computer. <br>

•	<b>Hard Disk</b> is a permanent storing device that holds all datas. Hard disk comes in various sizes, and the bigger the size of a Hard Disk the more program it can hold. Examples of hard disk size are 80GB, 160GB, 250GB, 320GB, 500GB etc. <strong>(GB means Giga-byte, which is the Measurement Unit of a Hard Disk Drive)</strong>.<br><br>

•	<b>Floppy disk drives</b> on the other hand hold a removable disk known as a floppy disk or diskette. The diskette can store small amount of information. And it can be used to transfer information from one computer to another. Most diskette can hold 1.44mb of data. Diskette can go bad very easily if not handled with care, which can lead to losses of information.<br><br>
•	<b>CD-Rom drive</b> holds a removable compact disk. It can be used to run programs, playing music and show movies. The CD-Rom can hold more data than diskette. It can hold about 650mb of data.<br><br>

2.	<b>The Monitor</b>
 is used to display information from the system unit. Another name for monitor is <b>visual display unit</b>. There are two types of monitor and these are <b>MONOCHROME</b> and <b>RGB monitor</b>. The MONOCHROME MONITOR displays only Two colours which is black and white, while the RGB MONITOR display many colours. The full meaning of RGB is <b><i>Red, Green and Blue</i></b>. There are different types of RGB and these are: <b>CGA</b> (Colour Graphic Adaptor), <b>EGA</b> (Enhance Graphic Adaptor), <b>VGA</b> (video graphic array) <b>SVGA</b> (Super Video Graphic Array).<br><br>

3. <b>The keyboard</b>
The last part of a computer is the keyboard. Keyboard is used to type instructions into the computer to process. The common keys found on the keyboard are:<br><br>
<b>Function keys</b><br>
These keys are labeled from <b><i>F1 to F12</i></b> and are used to send instructions to the computer. They do not have any definite function but their functions at any time depend on the program you are using. These keys are also called programmable keys.<br><br>

<b>Standard keys</b><br><br>
There are the keys you used to type instruction and data into a computer and they are those keys that made up of the letters keys, punctuation keys, number keys, the spacebar, and the shift and enter keys.<br><br>

<b>Arrow keys</b><br><br>
These keys are used to move around the screen in the direction indicated on the key. There are four arrow keys; these are the <i>Left, Right, Up, Down Arrow keys</i>.<br><br>
<b>Caps Lock</b><br><br>
The Caps Lock key is used to change typing mode from <b>LOWER CASE</b> <i>(small letter)</i> to <b>UPPERCASE</b> <i>(capital letter)</i> when activated.<br><br>

<b>The shift keys</b><br><br>
When the caps lock is not activated and you hold the shift key and type, it will give you <b>(capital letter)</b> characters, but when the caps lock key is activated already and you hold the shift key, it will now give you <b>(small letter)</b> characters. And also if a key on the keyboard has two symbols and you want to get the upper symbol, you hold down the shift key and press the key. E.g. To get the <b>+sign</b>, you hold down the shift key and press the key that has the <b>= sign</b>it will gives you the <strong>(+) Plus Sign</strong>.<br><br> 


<b>The spacebar</b><br><br>
This key is to give space between words when typing.<br><br>

<b>Computer virus</b><br>
Computer virus is not living organisms as most people think them to be but they behaves like normal human viruses.<br><br> 

<i>So what is a computer virus?</i><br><br>
Computer virus is ordinary programs written to disturb and hinder the smooth performance of a computer system. And these viruses can hide themselves in a program or disk without being detected and causes damage to the computer system. They behave like normal human virus we known and they can multiply without human assistance or knowledge. They work on the principle that when the software is copied or open for specified number of times, the virus is activated and then go into the computer system to destroy files and make the computer to malfunction.<br><br>

<b>How Viruses are Spread</b><br><br>   
Computer viruses can be spread in many ways. <br>The most common way of introducing these into a computer are:<br><br>
1.	To use a diskette that have virus<br><br>
2.	To run a program that contains virus<br><br>
3.	By connect two hard disk together then later transferred information from one to another computer.<br><br>
4.	Through Internet browse<br><br>
Different viruses affect computer in different ways. Some viruses make the computer run very slowly or make them to make unexpected noises; some viruses may delete files on the hard disk. They can even corrupt your Booting programs and make them not to work well. At times the computer will display irritating message on the screen.<br><br> Examples of these computer viruses are:<br><br> 
(1)	Trojan<br><br>
(2)	 Friday the 13th<br><br> 
(3)	 November 26th<br><br> 
(4)	Lucifer<br><br>
(5)	Stone<br><br>
(6)	Die Hard<br><br>
(7)	V-sign<br><br>
(8)	Jumper B<br><br>
(9)	Natal  and Aids etc.<br><br>

<b>PREVENTION AND CURE OF VIRUSES</b>
There are many steps you can take to ensure that your computer does not get infected virus. But the most reliable and efficient method is the use of <b>anti- virus software</b>. These are programs when installed in a computer can be used to detect and remove viruses from computers and diskettes. Examples of anti-virus software are:- <br><br>1. Dr. Solomon’s Anti-virus Toolkit. <br><br>2. Central Point Anti-virus (cpav), <br><br>3. Norton Anti-virus and P-Cilin etc.<br> 

All these software’s contain scanners, which can search for and delete viruses from disksor yor computer.<br><br><br>
