<td><p style="text-align:justify">As a small business owner you probably think you can't afford a professional website, but you can't afford NOT to. Although the cost of designing a website varies, once it's up and running, a website for a small businesses generally is not order cost when compared with the cost of a Newspaper Advert, Radio Advert, Tv Advert when you consider the potential market you can reach with a website, it is a very cost effective way to promote your business. Having a website for your business is the wisest decision a real business man has to take during business planning.
Having a personal website up and running, potential customer from all parts world of can directly contact you and negotiate business with you in a less-stressful time. It is an open door to customers because they need not to come to your office neither your shop before transaction take place.<br><br>
Recently, surveyed was out on the number of people that transact business online and of those who goes to the offices and chops for transaction, it was revealed that in 100% of business men & women,  80 percent (80%) of the people are transacting business online while 20 percent (20%) of them transact business on face to face contact that shows the extend which technology has gone.<br> 
Today, technology is growing rapidly and everybody want to follows that trend to put his or her business in the topline of the ICT World. One of the best way to achieve these is to take your business to the ICT global village where millions of people are dare need of your goods and services. It doesn't matter the nature of your business, somewhere-somehow somebody needs your services.<br>
In recent interview with Mr. Thompson Welder a boutique owner at West-End Airport Road, he said; I quote “I have been in the Dark Business Environment all these years where only those who passes by and those that are in my contact are willing to buy clothes from me, that comes around my store.<br><br>
Despite constant effort to advertise on radio, television and newspaper every month, my sales wasn’t satisfactory, having considered all expenses on adverts”. 
My breakthrough comes where I was complaining bitterly to a friend of mine “Mr. Fairwind” who laughed at me at first upon hearing my bitter complains. He said to me “Information is Power that if am not informed I will not No.” I then asked him what exactly does he mean, It was then he said to me that I should imagine millions of people visiting my store on a daily bases and at the same time imagine millions of sales been made on a daily bases in my store with just little resources. I then asked again how possible can that be, the he said “Your Business Need Fresh Ideas”, I said ok that he should put me through that Fresh Ideas.
He said to me that I should take my business to the Global Village Market where around the whole world can visit and purchase my goods from any part of the world. That the money I having been using for advert locally, I should put it together and purchase website for my business and place my goods and services over there that is all. Mmmmm, dear at first I wasn’t convinced but later time when I give it a try about everything Mr. Fairwind told me, from that very time till today my business has growing tremendously and it was at this point, that I totally agreed with him that “Information Is Power”. Today I have my Website Ups and Running and my business has be boosted from 35% to 92% within a period of one year. Am grateful to Mr. Fairwind my great friend.
Today, eventually everything you need are in the internet, through the use of Google search, there is nothing you cannot find on the internet.
